- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mikerniker
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS on Free Code Camp and Python in Udemy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people in the future. Not sure what that will be yet, since I'm still new at this. But my future self hopes to work with you soon!
